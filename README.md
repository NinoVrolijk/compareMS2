# compareMS2

This project concerns the compareMS2 software for molecular phylogenetics by direct comparison of tandem mass spectra, and the associated generation of distance matrices and novel compareMS2GUI graphical user interface.

## Getting Started

This file is dedicated to getting the user started with the compareMS2Gui. The readme.md consist of system prerequisites and various instructions.

### Prerequisites

The programs and libraries that need to be installed to run the CompareMS2Gui software.

```
- Python 3. available from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- ETE3 Toolkit.
- Pyqt5.
```

### Installing
Series of step to make the system ready for the software.

#### Windows
```
1. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download python version 3. for Windows.
3. Open the cmd.
4. Type : pip install PyQt5
5. Type : pip install Ete3
6. Install and run the CompareMS2Gui.exe
Now you have all required programs and libraries present.
```
